### HashTag StayHome

Probably the most popular coronavirus-related hashtag on the internet right now, this hashtag urges people to stay at home. By staying home, fewer people are out and about, so the virus is less likely to spread. This especially helps those who are more at risk to get seriously ill from the deadly disease. The hashtag crops up mostly on Twitter and Instagram, and Instagram even has a ‚Äústay home‚Äù sticker to add to your stories.
