## Introduction

The 2019‚Äì20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak originated in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019 and until 20 April 2020, more than 2.5 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 175,000 deaths and almost 690,000 recoveries.

### HashTag StayHome

Probably the most popular coronavirus-related hashtag on the internet right now, this hashtag urges people to stay at home. By staying home, fewer people are out and about, so the virus is less likely to spread. This especially helps those who are more at risk to get seriously ill from the deadly disease. The hashtag crops up mostly on Twitter and Instagram, and Instagram even has a ‚Äústay home‚Äù sticker to add to your stories.
